## SECTION 3: Data Sharing Details

When you marked data as "Shared", you need to specify who you share it with:

### For data shared with third parties:

**Third parties you share data with:**
1. **Google LLC (Firebase Services)**
   - Analytics data
   - Crash logs
   - Diagnostics
   - Device IDs
   - App interactions

2. **Google LLC (AdMob)**
   - Device IDs (Advertising ID)
   - App interactions (for ad serving)

**Important:** In the Data Safety section, you should state:
- ✅ Data is shared with third parties
- ✅ Data is used for analytics purposes
- ✅ Data is used for advertising purposes
- ✅ Data is encrypted in transit
- ✅ Users can request data deletion

---

## SECTION 4: Additional Important Settings

### Security practices to highlight:
- ✅ "Data is encrypted in transit" - YES (SSL/TLS)
- ✅ "Users can request that data be deleted" - YES (via email)
- ⚠️ "Data is encrypted at rest" - Check with Supabase settings (likely YES)
- ⚠️ "You follow the Families Policy" - NO (unless targeting children)
- ✅ "An independent security review has been performed" - Only if true

### Privacy Policy URL:
```
https://mobilecraftapps-lang.github.io/freshkeeper.github.io/
```

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES:

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

1. **Don't forget AdMob data collection**: AdMob automatically collects device IDs and approximate location for ad serving

2. **Firebase collects data too**: Even though you use Firebase, this counts as "sharing" data with Google

3. **Premium features**: If premium users have different data collection (like exports), this should still be declared since ALL users see the data safety info

4. **Referral leaderboard**: Since referral data is shown publicly, this counts as "sharing" but with other users, not third parties

### 📝 Data NOT Collected (You can answer NO to these):

- ❌ Precise location
- ❌ Approximate location (unless AdMob collects it - check your AdMob settings)
- ❌ Audio files
- ❌ Photos
- ❌ Videos
- ❌ Video files (unless users can add product videos)
- ❌ Music files
- ❌ Other files
- ❌ Calendar events
- ❌ Contacts
- ❌ Voice or sound recordings
- ❌ Health and fitness data
- ❌ Messages (SMS, email, chat)
- ❌ Physical address
- ❌ Phone number
- ❌ Race and ethnicity
- ❌ Political or religious beliefs
- ❌ Sexual orientation
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Web bookmarks
